Hey, so I blast in our chats and got totally nerd-sniped by the thing you're trying to create.

I made this doc, mostly while walking and to the office again (so please excluse its crudeness). But it's my pitch for the the first quarter of working with a video creator.

## Summary

[Reinforce](#reinforce). [Connect](#connect). [Create](#create).

## Reinforce

Reinforce the migration to video podcast with platform-specific capabilities: cards (dynamic but distruptive). Think Amazon Prime X-Ray.

This helps distinguish video as a unique (higher fidelity) Syntax. experience.

The videos would created in a short-form, vertical format for maximal re-distrubution. And should include a callout to the initiating episode: â€œlearn more about {X} at syntax.fm/{#}

These are a few candidates I pulled from the latest epised, that could use visual/educational reinforcement.

## Connect

Connect the dots between video, social, and website.

Explore a cooperative workflow, where high priority videos are identified.

See if we can record and insert video augmentation right into the video podcast [VH1 Pop-up video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Up_Video).
This is something that people loved in [Storybook's Storytime interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxwDAMQGa0g&list=PLw6GJy26kmCIaRN1oVXNA8eBlWjP7N5Q_) series.

Unlike the cards approach (above), this is completely non-disruptive to the core content.

## Create

After my chat with Ben, I would prioritize higher effort, more exhaustive, more durable, non-podcast formats for the channel. I think this would provide a broader counter-point to news-driven formats.

There are two formats that I think would do well here. And the shape they would take for the latest episode (if the response justified additional content):

- The Syntax Guide to SQL: The 20 commands, operators, and features you HAVE to know.
- A brief History of ORMs: How they came to be and why they are still relevant.

## Notes

The transcript seems to prefer "Century" not "Sentry" ðŸ˜…
