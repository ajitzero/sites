					Hey <strong>Syntax. &times; Sentry</strong> üëã

					We programmers try to live by "show; don't tell."<br
					/>
					 I think that's why many of us love video so much!
					<p></p>
					 So, in addition to my <a

					>, these are recent video projects that I'm quite
					proud of.

							We have a very small team. And I'm most proud of

							re-integrated into <a
