## Context

The pull of web infrastructure is strong for me.
I regularly feel like I'm capping myself by not understanding how AWS works and how to leverage it.

Most recently, [sst](https://sst.dev/) got me really excited — especially with their `AstroSite` integration.

But now is not the right time to take that plunge.

## Decision

I'm sticking with Netlify for the immediate future.
I can re-evaluate this once I've completed Epic React production.

## Consequences

- I may build some "server"-side features with a little Netlify lock-in. I accept the eventual re-write.
- I don't have what to do with my Nettlify redirects. That's nice.
