## Screen setup

## Motion

### Punch in

Punching in helps folks no what _not_ to worry about (or what _could_ be imortant).

Ensure that you'll be punched into that area for a reasonal ammount of time.
It's irritating to drop in, just to drop back out 2 seconds later.
Before punching in determine the out point.

Punching in works best when activity starts.
This could be:

- moving the cursor into position
- moving the mouse into position
- me shifting what i'm looking at from camera to Screen

When doing this with motion, think of the section you're punching into as an area boundary. Punch in, just in time, to see that area come into focus — or mouse move into.

### Panning

Panning really never looks good.
Commit to zooming/punching in and out.
