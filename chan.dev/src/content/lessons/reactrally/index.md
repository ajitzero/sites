title: "React Rally 2023"
---

## Style

- lots of googling (chatGPTing)
- i believe that every repeatable process can be broken down into individual steps. so we'll go thru those in this workshop
- the value of today is getting your questions answered so ask up. I'll try to limit answers to 2 minutes (so we don't disrupt the whole class). but will keep track of anything that needs more time for breaks
- goal is to prepare you for React Rally
  - It took me the better part of a decade to learn all this stuff. you won't learn it overnight
- exposure thru experience (you need to type it all out)
- karate kid. learning these things will provide you an excellent foundation.
