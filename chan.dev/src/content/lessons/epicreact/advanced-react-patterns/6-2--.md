title: 'Default State Reducer, solution'

Our toggle function is really simple. But imagine that the reducer included a lot more action types and logic.

By simply coppying the implementation, we would need to consider this code anytime the hook code updates. And there's a high chance we'll forget — creating inconsistencies in the UX.

Fortunately, we can sovle this by delegating state changes to the default reducer.

- In the `toggle` module, export the default `toggleReducer` — making it available to other modules.
- Import that `toggleReducer` into app `app`
