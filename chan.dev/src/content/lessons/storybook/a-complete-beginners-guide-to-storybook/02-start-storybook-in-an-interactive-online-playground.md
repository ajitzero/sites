[Screen: Show Storybook landing. Type storybook.new. Go]

In a browser, visit storybook.new.

This short url takes you to a page that allows you to quickly start up a Storybook sandbox.

[Screen: Scroll through available Storybook sandboxes]

A Storybook sandbox is a ready-to-code environment composed of a UI library, language, builder, and framework.

[Screen: Select sandbox]

Choose a sandbox that matches your project or personal preference. I’ll use React:JavaScript:Vite. While I’m using React-JavaScript-Vite for demonstration. But the principles apply across different sandboxes. So feel free to choose any that you prefer.

[Split-screen: Storybook UI on the right, code on the left]

You should see three panels:

- File explorer [left]
- Code editor [center]
- Browser [right]

[Screen: click through sample stories]

Storybook Sandboxes initialize with sample stories to demonstrate common features — these samples showcase features we'll examine in detail throughout this course.

[Screen: navigate to project file explorer]

In the editor, you’ll find the setup for the Sandbox you chose. And in it, a `/stories` directory. In my React—Vite sandbox, this directory is in `src/stories`. If you chose a different sandbox, the stories might be located in a similar directory structure suited to that framework.

[Screen: show StackBlitz sharing bar]

Try modifying a story or component in the code editor and watch the browser panel update immediately with your changes. This is how you'll observe the impact of your work in real time.

When you’re ready, use the sharing options provided by StackBlitz to showcase your Storybook to colleagues or on social media — we’d love to see what you create!
