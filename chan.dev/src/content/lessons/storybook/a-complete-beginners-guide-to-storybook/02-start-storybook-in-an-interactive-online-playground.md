In a browser, visit [storybook.new](https://storybook.new).

This page lets you quickly start up a Storybook sandbox.

A Storybook sandbox is a ready-to-code environment composed of a UI library, language, builder, and framework.

Choose a sandbox that matches your project or personal preference.

I’ll use React/JavaScript/Vite.
You don't have to use the same Storybook Sandbox as I am.
The lessons in this course work across different sandboxes.

You should see three panels:

- File explorer, left
- Code editor, center
- Browser, right

Storybook Sandboxes initialize with sample stories — these sample stories showcase features we'll examine throughout this course.

For now, I just want you to locate them.

In the file explorer, look for a `/stories` directory.
In my React—Vite sandbox, this directory is in `src/stories`.
If you chose a different sandbox, the stories may be in a similar but different location.

Open a the primary button story in both the code editor and browser panels.
Make a modifacation to the text to see an immediate change in Storybook.
