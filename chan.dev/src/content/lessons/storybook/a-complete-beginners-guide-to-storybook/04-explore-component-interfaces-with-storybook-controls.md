In Storybook, we can interactively explore and stress-tost components with Controls.

- Select any story to open it in the Canvas.
- Click the Shortcuts cog to ensure that the Addons panel is visible.
- Finally, select the Controls tab.

Every prop for this component has a corresponding control.
Change values to see how your handles different inputs.

- Change the primary boolean prop with this toggle.
- Change the label string.
- You can even change background-color with a color picker.

Controls make it possible for anyone to exlore new combinations without having to manipulate code.

With controls, more teammates can become part of the component development and stress-testing process — building more robust components together.
