[Screen: Display a component within the Storybook UI]

Storybook Controls are dynamic and interactive tools that enable you to explore and stress-test your components. Let's dive into how you can use these controls to understand and enhance component behavior.

[Screen: Highlighting the Controls addon in the Storybook UI]

Find the Controls addon panel, usually located at the bottom of your Storybook interface. If it's not visible, you can enable it from the addons menu.

[Screen: Showing a component with adjustable props in the Controls panel]

Each prop of your component is represented here as a control. You can manipulate these in real time to see how your component responds to different inputs and states.

[Screen: Interactively adjusting a prop]

Let's say your component has a 'size' prop. Use the Controls to adjust the size and observe the component resize instantly within the canvas.

[Screen: Using Controls to simulate different user interactions]

Go further by simulating user interactions. Change the state of a toggle or click a button within the Controls panel, and watch your component react as if a user is interacting with it.

[Screen: Discussing the value of Controls for component testing]

This immediate feedback from the Controls is invaluable for testing. It allows you to ensure that your component interface behaves correctly under a variety of conditions.

[Screen: Encouraging experimentation with different prop combinations]

Experiment with different combinations of props to thoroughly explore the capabilities of your component. This interactive process can help you identify any potential issues or improvements.

With Storybook Controls, you've gained a powerful insight into your component's interface and behavior, allowing for a more robust design and development process.
