The Storybook Addon Toolbar provides one-click access to essential visual debugging tools.

- Select any story
- And ensure that the Addon Toolbar is visible, via the shortcut menu.
- When enabled, you'll find it above the canvas.

We'll just take a quick tour, from left to right.

**Zoom**

Zoom in and out to see how your component handles scale.

**Background**

Inspect how your component on a dark or light background — ensuring visual versitility.

**Grid**

I hate fixed grids but you may have a use for this one.

**Viewport**

Viewport addon is perfect for responsive testing. Select different device sizes to simulate how your components scale across devices.

**Measure**

Measure is everything you might expect from Chrome DevTools but just one click away and available to non-developers as well.
It's great for verifying the finer aspects of design implementation.

**Outline**

And finally, outline is perfect for tracking down those spacing bugs where one component is some invisible layout.

By using the Addon Toolbar, you’ve now debugged and refined your components, ensuring they are ready for any user experience.
