The Storybook Addon Toolbar is a suite of tools that allow you to manipulate the appearance and behavior of components within the Storybook canvas. Let’s learn how to use some of these tools to refine and debug your components.

First, locate the Addon Toolbar at the top of the canvas. This toolbar is where you’ll find tools like zoom, background color, measure, outline, and viewport.

[Screen: Using the zoom tool]

Begin with the zoom tool, represented by a magnifying glass icon. Click on it and select a zoom level to closely inspect components or view them from a distance.

Next, use the background color tool to change the canvas background. This is especially useful for seeing how your components look against different backgrounds, ensuring they're visually versatile.

The measure tool allows you to check the dimensions and spacing of your components. Activate it and hover over a component to see width, height, and space between elements.

[Screen: Outlining elements]

With the outline tool, you can toggle outlines around elements, which is invaluable for checking alignment and layout without affecting the actual styles.

[Screen: Adjusting the viewport]

Finally, the viewport tool is perfect for responsive testing. Select different device sizes to simulate how your components scale across devices.

[Screen: Saving the Storybook state]

Once you’re satisfied with your adjustments, you can save the current state of your Storybook, preserving these tool settings for the next time you open it.
