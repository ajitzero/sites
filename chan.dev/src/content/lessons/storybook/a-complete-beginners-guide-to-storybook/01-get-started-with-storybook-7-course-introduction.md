## Intro

- Hey! Welcome to this crash course on Storybook 7!
- Together we're going to develop a quick and comprehensive understanding of how to build UI in Storybook 7.
- By the end of this course, you'll know everything you need to know to get Started with Storybook and integrate it into your existing component or application projects!
- And if you fallow along, you'll have some practical experience to boast about to!

## About me

- I'm chantastic.
- I've been teaching React for 10 years here, on YouTube, and on my interview podcast, React Podcast.
- Recently I've tought everything I know about Storybook on both the Storybook YouTube channel and in talks around the globe.
- This course is everything I've learned about at developers and designers who have never touched Storybook before.

## Prerequisites

- I assume that you have strong JavaScript experience and a little bit of working HTML and CSS knowledge.
- But you don't have to know anything about Storybook. We'll cover all that together.

## About the course

- To keep things simple, the majority of the course will happen in a cloud environment. So there's nothing to set up!
- And we'll cover every feature in two-passes.
  - First, we'll look at the feature in Storybook's UI — referencing a coulpe sample components.
  - Then, we'll recreate the sample stories from scratch.

## Outro

- I'm thrilled to share this with you.
- This is going to supercharge your capability as a UI developer.
- And I can't wait to see what you and your teams build with it.
- Let's get started!
