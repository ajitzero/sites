Storybook is designed to integrate smoothly into your existing project, no matter which framework you're using. Let's walk through the steps to add Storybook to your development workflow.

[Screen: Opening the terminal in the project's root directory]

In your project’s root directory, open the terminal. Here we'll run the Storybook initialization command suitable for your project's framework.

[Screen: Running the Storybook initialization command]

For frameworks like Next.js or Angular, Storybook provides specific CLI commands. Type npx sb init and let Storybook detect your framework and set itself up accordingly.

Watch as Storybook installs the necessary dependencies and adds scripts to your package.json file. It will also create a .storybook folder where your configuration files live.

[Screen: Editing configuration files for framework-specific adjustments]

If needed, make any framework-specific adjustments to the Storybook configuration files. For instance, you might want to align webpack configurations with those of Next.js or Angular.

[Screen: Running Storybook locally with the new setup]

Run npm run storybook or yarn storybook to start Storybook locally. It should open up in your default web browser, showing the Storybook interface.

[Screen: Navigating the newly integrated Storybook UI]

Navigate through the newly set up Storybook. You’ll see that it reflects the components and structure of your existing project.

[Screen: Encouraging the addition of new stories for existing components]

Begin adding new stories for your existing components. This will help you visualize component states and interact with them in isolation from your app.

[Screen: Commit changes to version control]

Commit the new Storybook files and configuration changes to your version control system. This ensures the whole team can access and collaborate using Storybook.
