[Demo the sample stories from another example]
Our sample stories came with this really cool documentation.
These must be really hard to implement, right?

Nope! It's just one line of config.

- Open the `Button` story file.
- Add a tags array to component meta.
- And add the tag `autodocs`.

```js
{
	tags: ['autodocs']
}
```

That's literally it.
And look at all this documentation we get!!

A playground.
Copy-pastable code.
Detailed interface documentation.

All with one line of code. This is the power of Storybook.

Documentation is a crucial part of development, and Storybook's autodocs feature simplifies the process by turning code comments into rich, interactive docs.

[Screen: Showing code comments in a component file]

Begin by ensuring your components are well-commented. Include descriptions of props, their types, and default values right in your code.

[Screen: Illustrating the use of JSDoc style comments]

Use JSDoc-style comments to provide detailed information. For example, annotate a prop with /\*_ @param {string} label - The text displayed on the button _/.

[Screen: Storybook's 'Docs' tab with generated documentation]

Switch to the 'Docs' tab in your Storybook UI. With autodocs, Storybook parses your comments and displays them as part of the autogenerated documentation for each component.

[Screen: Exploring the autogenerated props table]

Explore the autogenerated props table. It should reflect the types, default values, and descriptions from your JSDoc comments.

[Screen: Encouraging best practices in commenting for documentation]

Adopt the habit of documenting as you code. This ensures your autodocs are always up to date and reduces the need for separate documentation efforts.

By using autodocs, you've created a living document that grows and evolves with your codebase, making your documentation process efficient and integrated.
