## Contents

## Learner outcome

- Confident navigating Storybook UI
- Confident in creating new components and stories
- Competent in domain terminology and concepts
- Capable of finding answers utilizing docs and community
- Curious about visual regression testing using Chromatic

## Topics included

- Navigate Storybook UI
- Inspect and manipulate Stories with essential addons
- Write static stories using CSF + Args
- Write interactive stories using CSF + Play functions
- Install and register addons
- Basic documentation with Markdown
- Add global stylesheets and fonts
- Apply continuous visual regression testing with Chromatic

## Topics excluded

- UI libraries (React, Vue, Svelte, etc)
- Framework integrations (Next.js, SvelteKit, Angular, etc.)
- Builders (Vite, Webpack)
- Integrate with specific frameworks
- Data mocking and API integration
- Storybook v1-6

## Education style

Two-pass approach. Like Genesis 1. Say what happened in the abstract. Then say it again in concrete terms.

- Demonstrate features is the example stories
- Write new stories from scratch

## Sandbox

| Builder | Language   | Renderer |
| :------ | :--------- | :------- |
| Vite    | JavaScript | React    |

_This framework should provide the fastest, most approachable experience for most people._
