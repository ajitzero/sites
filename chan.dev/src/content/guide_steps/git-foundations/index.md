title: A Chantastic Guide to Git Foundations
---

Git is the language of software collaboration.

Contributors communicate through commits and pull requests.  
Humans communicate with computers through continuous intergation and deployment.  
And even companies communicate with cutsomers through reliable feature development and rollbacks.  

In this gentle guide to git, you'll learn all of the commands that I use on a daily basis. Commands to build this site, collaborate on open software, support community.

You don't need to know anything about to learn. But even if you're a seasoned pro, you may walk away with a fresh perspective on what makes git great.  

Welcome to my guide to git foundations.
