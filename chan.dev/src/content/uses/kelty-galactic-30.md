## Review

This bag isâ€¦ ok.

I find the duck down to be a more tempermental than than technical insulation.
It doesn't loft withou intentionally shacking it out and fluffing it up.
Down has a tendency to clump.

But the colors are nice and it's a good temperature for most Southern California tent camping.
