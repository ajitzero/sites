## Review

It's like a big puffer jacket.

It's a perfect fit for when camping in a small tent with an insulated matt.
It's not great for just about any other environment.

I took it to white water, where we slept under the stars.
Even with a unsulated matt, sweats, wool socks, my Patagonia jacket, and a beenie, I was VERY cold.
