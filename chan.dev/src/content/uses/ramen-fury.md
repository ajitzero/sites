Turns out we like [games themed around Japanese cuisine][sushi go party!].

This game is fun, quick, and combative â€” a good 4-person, 8+ game.

## Strategy

> Eat fast; eat well. Eat slow; stay hungry.

Ramen Fury is about finishing bowls, fast.
If you grew up in a big family, this will feel familiar.

You're rewarded for leaving margins and acting decisively.
Be the first to close 3 bowls and you'll probably win.
As the game progresses, stay ready to close.

### Notes

- [Count cards](#card-count)
- Favor move efficiency
- Chasing bowls of four makes you a target for offensive moves
- Only restock offensively. Trying to "see new cards" is a waste
- Use the 5 card limit as a way to discard unwanted cards
- 3 of a kind (chicken) can be a play maker

### Moves

- Spoon to close
