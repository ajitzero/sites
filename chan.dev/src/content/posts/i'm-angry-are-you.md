My dad wanted to be white.

He married a white girl.
He took us to white church.
He had white friends and white business partners.
He refused to teach us Chinese.
And on family vacations he'd stay out of the sun because he didn't want to get "too tan."

He went places he wasn't welcome and he took us with him.
I got my confidence from him
But I came with a big white chip on my shoulder.

I saw him take shit.
I watched him jump through extra hoops and get passed over.
He was laughed at, dismissed, overlooked and so were we.

I'm angry about it.
That anger comes out in unpredictable ways.
And I see folks who endure true racial tragedies and think about how angry they are.
I think about how angry they have right to be.

I don't know what to do with that.
But I want to be honest:
We're not good.
I'm angry.
And I think you might be too.

What can we do?
How do we overcome our wounds and move closer to each other?
