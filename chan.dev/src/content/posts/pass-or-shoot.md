When you stop dribbling in basketball, you have to pass or shoot.

You can’t make a little progress, pause and ponder, and then pick up the play.

The game continues, and you just cut your options by a third.
It’s now time to pass or shoot.

In my career — and as a creator — I’ve paused when I should have played. I believed that if I couldn’t drive it all the way — myself — I could pause and see what happened. And I’d lose to the clock.

I want to do things differently this time. If I pause, I need to pass or shoot. Trust my team or trust my self and make the play.
