## Instructions

Add this GitHub Action to your repo at
`.github/workflows/schedule-netlify-build.yml`

```yaml
# .github/workflows/schedule-netlify-build.yml

name: Schedule Netlify Build
on:
  schedule:
    # Customize schedule expression at crontab.guru
    # This one runs at 800 UTC daily
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'
jobs:
  build:
    name: Call Netlify build hook
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Curl request
        run: curl -X POST -d {} #YOUR_BUILD_HOOK_URL#
```

### Tailor your cron schedule

Determine a build schedule and use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to describe it as a cron schedule expression.

```diff lang="yaml"
-    # This one runs at 800 UTC daily
-   - cron: "0 8 * * *"
+    # This one runs every 6 hours
+   - cron: "* */6 * * *"
```

### Generate a Netlify build hook

Netlify build hooks are webhooks with one function: re-build your site when called. Any `POST` request to your Netlify build hook triggers a build.

Generate a new build hook here:
**Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous deployment > Build hooks**.

![Settings path: Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous deployment > Build hooks](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/51b3c2b9b2cb2eb70fd9631385a2b0d2bc60b1ea/45997/images/configure-builds-build-hooks.png)

_You have to name your hook. The name doesn't make much difference as long as it's unique and descriptive to you._

### Paste your build hook into the GitHub Action

```diff lang="yaml"
-        run: curl -X POST -d {} #YOUR_BUILD_HOOK_URL#
+        run: curl -X POST -d {} https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/#GENERATED_BUILD_HOOK_URL
```

### Push!

Push your new workflow up to your repository and watch the **Actions** tab. You'll seeing scheduled jobs show up, according to your schedule.

## Extra credit

Get fancy and ensure that nobody spams your build hook with a [GitHub Action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow).

## A Story

### Dynamic Site; Static Builds

Over at [lunch.dev](https://www.lunch.dev), we've built a [calendar of events](https://events.lunch.dev) in [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) (a slick static site generator).

Events are listed under **Upcoming** and **Past** event headings based on their publishDate. Because Eleventy generates static sites, that deterimation happens at build time.

If we want to keep data fresh, **we have to manually re-build the site at least once per day**.

Using Netlify build hooks, we can automate those builds on a schedule!

There are plenty of services that will run a cron job. What I like about a GitHub Actions based solution is that everything is kept in the repo. The source can be maintained and documented with the rest of the project!
