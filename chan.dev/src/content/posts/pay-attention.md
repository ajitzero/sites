As an adult, I'm often chasing novelty â€”  
New destinations, experiences, and abilities.

This weekend, Nellie and I took the family to Utah â€” a new place we'd never been.

It was our first plane-trip as just our family of four.  
We weren't visiting in-laws or traveling with friends â€” we were just exploring the planet.

For all the planning, money, and coordination that it took, the kids both agreed that their favorite part was watching movies and playing games with us.

I don't regret for a second taking them.  
I LOVE hearing them talk about adventures they've had in different states.  
But it reminded me â€” once again â€”  
The best gift you can give is attention.
