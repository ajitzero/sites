title: Shame

There are no shortage of developmental moments shrouded in shame. But I think the ones that hit the most are those involving my parents.

…the time I said poop in church. the feeling over every adult in the room swinging their head to me. and my parents immediately throwing me under the bus…

Related, dinners where I felt like we were getting socially punished every time we did things that were regularly allowed in our house.

Prerequisite post:
- something about growing up with the mindset of assimilation
- something about my paronts to link to that makes it feel less mean
