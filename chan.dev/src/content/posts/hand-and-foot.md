## 🃏 Card Values

<div class="max-w-[24ch]">

|  Value | Card                   |          |
| -----: | :--------------------- | :------: |
|   `50` | Joker                  | **Wild** |
|   `20` | 2 "Deuces"             | **Wild** |
|   `20` | Ace                    |          |
|   `10` | _10, J, Q, K[^*]_      |          |
|    `5` | _4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9[^*]_ |          |
|    `0` | Black 3                |          |
| `-500` | Red 3                  |          |

[^*]: Notes: Traditionally, `5` and `10` point values are `4-7` and `8-K`, respectively.

</div>

## 🆙 Achievement Values

<div class="max-w-[24ch]">

| Value | Achievement                                      |
| ----: | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `500` | [Red book](#📕-red-book)                         |
| `300` | [Black book](#📓-black-book)                     |
| `100` | _[Draw](#🎰-the-deal-draw) exactly 22 cards[^†]_ |
| `100` | First to [go out](#👈-go-out)                    |

[^†]: Both [Canasta][]/[Hand and Foot][] have a traditional "deal." This better distributes the cards and "de-clumps" them from previous melds and books.

</div>

## 🎟️ Point Minimums

At the start of each round, teams determine the mimimum points required to [go in](#👉-go-in).

<div class="max-w-[24ch]">

|    Score | Points required to go in |
| -------: | :----------------------- |
|      `0` | `50`                     |
|   `2500` | `90`                     |
|   `5000` | `120`                    |
| _`7500`_ | _`150`[^‡]_              |

[^‡]: [Canasta][] is traditionally played to 5000 points. And [Hand and Foot][] is traditionally in 4 rounds, with no point-based end condition.

</div>

## 🥅 Goal

Gain the most points as a team by the end game condition: `10,000` points[^‡].

## 🏗️ Build the Stock (Game Deck)

Each player brings one deck of cards to construct a card stock (game deck).  
**Ensure that all decks include both Jokers (54 cards).**

## 🎰 The Deal (draw)

To start each round, players draw `22` cards.
Drawing `22` cards in a single cut, is worth a `100` points bonus.[^*]

Cards are divided into two `11` card decks: ["hand" and "foot"](#✋🦶hand-and-foot).

## 🏁 Begin the Game

Reveal the top card from [the stock](#🏗️-build-the-stock-game-deck) to start a discard pile. The first person (clockwise) of the dealer begins the first [turn](#↪️-turn).

## ↪️ Turn

- [Draw.](#🪣-draw)
- Create [melds](#💿-meld).
- Discard.

## ✋🦶Hand and Foot

The _hand_ is a player's initial hand of 11 cards — played immediately.
The _foot_ is a player's 11 reserve cards — played once the _hand_ is exhausted.

Play all `11` cards in your hand by creating melds with your team.

If you can finish your hand without discarding the final card of your _hand_, continue playing into your foot. _Announce "I'm going into my foot" to the table._

## 🪣 Draw

Draw two cards from the [stock pile](#🏗️-build-the-stock-game-deck).

**OR**

[Talk the discards](#🗑️-take-discards).

## 🗑️ Take Discards

If the top card of the discard pile is a natural card (4-A) _and_ matches at least one card in your hand, you may draw from the discard pile.

- Reveal your card that matchs the top discard.
- Take the top seven cards.
- You must be able to make a new, clean book with that top card.
- If you are not able to make a clean book, you will be penalized.

_Current house penalty:_

- Your turn is skipped (including discard).
- Return all drawn cards to the discard pile (in their same order).
- Take a `100` point penalty.

## 💿 Meld

Three or more cards of the same value (suit does not matter).  
Melds may include [wilds cards](#🃏-card-values), to form [Black books](#📓-black-book).  
**Melds must always contain more natural cards than wilds.**

## 📚 Books

Books are melds with `7` (or more) cards.

- [Red books](#📕-red-book) include `7` or more natural cards.
- [Black books](#📓-black-book) include _exactly_ `7` natural _and_ wild cards, with no more than `3` wilds.

## 📕 Red Book

_AKA: "Clean book", "Open book"._

- `7` or more natural cards.
- "Open" to melding.
- Set aside with a _red_ card on top.

## 📓 Black Book

_AKA: "Dirty book", "Closed book"._

- Exactly `7` natural _and_ wild cards.
- At most `3` wild cards.
- "Closed" to melding.
- Set aside with a _black_ card on top.

## 👉 Go In

A player "goes in" when they can create, or contribute, to melds. with their total number of contributed cards being above the points minimum.

## 👈 Go Out

A player "goes out" they discard the final card of their foot — ending the round.

A player may not go out until:

- All teammates are in their foot.
- The team has developed [4 Black Books](#📓-black-book) and [5 Red Books](#📕-red-book).

Before going out, a player may ask their team "can I go out?" Teammates are allowed to respond only with "yes" or "no" — avoiding [table talk](#🗣️-table-talk).

## 🗣️ Table talk

Table talk is "illegal."

Every house has a different understanding of what constitutes table talk.

I find that strategic players enjoy playing strategic (educational) games. In these cases, [general strategy](#🗺️-general-strategy) is not considered table talk. Because strategic games aren't won on general strategy.

Here are a few things that are invariable considered table talk:

- Correcting (or "helping") a teammate place their move.
  - This includes asking suggestive questions like "Did you want me to place this on the dirty meld or create a new clean meld?"
- Asking teammates to decide between two options.
- Communicating about a move with the intent to suggest the composition of your hand "I really want to pick that discard up…"
- Inquiries about the makeup of the discard pile.

## 🗺️ General Strategy

Here are some baseline strategies for being a good teammate:

- It's generally advantagous to open options for teammates.
- Creating [Red Books](#📕-red-book) doesn't cost your team because they can continue to play melds on them.
- Creating [Black Books](#📓-black-book) should be reserved for:
  - [Going in](#👉-go-in).
  - [Going out](#👈-go-out).
  - Increasing your score before your opponent [goes out](#👈-go-out).
- Avoid discarding cards that you know your opponent can play — especially when you know there are duplicates in the top 7. See [Take Discards](#🗑️-take-discards).
- When deciding whether to contribute to dirty meld or create a new, clean meld, consider the following:
  - Is it early or late in the game?
  - How near to completion is the dirty meld?
  - What is the composition of the dirty meld? Can it be completed with wilds?
  - Does the opponent also have melds for this card — making it unclikely to be closed?
- [Taking the discards](#🗑️-take-discards) is best employed when you can create a meld for a card value you don't have available.
