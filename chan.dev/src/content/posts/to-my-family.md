Open your phone and search for me.
Does anything come up?

If _yes_, **this is for you**.

You're the elite few that have an _actual_ relationship with me.
So the things you see — here — may feel weird.
Like I'm talking past you to someone else.

I am.
But with complete sincerity.

It may feel like I'm "not the person you knew." And I'm probably not. Hell, you're **just** the person I know. So, let's swipe left on that. We share a narrow construction of each other that I hope to change.

I want to be a fuller me and hope that gives you space to be a fuller you.

It's ambitious — sure.
And if it feels like too much, use that phone number you have.
Or unfollow.
I accept both for us.

I love you.
And I hope to see more of you.
