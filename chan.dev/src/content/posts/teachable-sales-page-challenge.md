## Who is your target audience

### 1. Know your audience

- What are their _pain paints_ and _goals_?
- Where can you find them?

Teach what you know.

What do you know that will serve others?  
Is ther a wound you identify with that others experience?

## Identify your major milestones

### How to plan your online course

1. Identify your milestones
1. Break things down into lessons

### Milestones

- "What are the major steps students will need to take?"
- These are skills to be developed
- There's no magic number
- These milestones will become questions
- Your audience _EXPECTS_ you to break information into manageable chunks

## Outline your course

- Each lesson should cover one major takeaway
- Less that 10 minutes
- If you have to ask "could this be two videos?" the answer is "yes"
- This is about referencability of your content
  - Finding content in a video sucks

### Quantifying questions

- Can you you quantify the outcome of your transformation?
- How many times better is the outcome from the initial state?
- How long will it take a studend to achieve the transformation?
- How much time or money will students save by taking the course?
- How many steps will it take for a student to achieve the transformation?

Avoid statistics: number of lessons, hours, pages, etc.
