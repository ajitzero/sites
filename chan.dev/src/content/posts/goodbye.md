_Warning: suicidal thoughts and weapons._

For a few years, I've had this recurring unwanted thought:
I raise a gun to my temple and wait.

It's particularly troubling because I'm not suicidal.
I'm quite the opposite — often waking\ in a panic that death is clawing at me.

So, I've tried to diffuse the thought.
I've forced my own hand back down.
I've replaced the gun with a toy.
I've even resolved to it, accepting its presence as "motivation."

But it occurred to me that "I can pull the trigger."

Now, I was afraid to write that.
Because I worried about what you might think of me.
I was worried that you would worry — for me or someone else reading it.
That you'd read yourself into it.
And read me out of it.
And this kept me from even thinking thinking the thought.

This is a problem.
For years, I've not really been me.
I've been who I thought you wanted me to be.
Something in me knew that and put this challenge in front of me.
To say what I see, as I see it, and let go of perception.
