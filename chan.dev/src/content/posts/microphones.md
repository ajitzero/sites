Let me tell you which microphones to start with.

I own more than 20 microphones.
So I have strong and nuanced opinions.
I know that isn't helpful when you're starting your podcast or livestream,
So I've limited it to four.

I've chosen these four on their ability to build from one system to the next.

I haven't been able to finish the detail sections of my recommendation.
So, if you don't trust me, {% bug-me-on-twitter %}

## COVID CAVEAT

Many of these items have limited stock or prices have been inflated.
I've added B&H product links because they provide stock notifications.
Heads up: Amazon links are affiliate links.

## For \$60: Samson Q2u

Buy at: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2LlQjtX), [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/598772-REG/Samson_SAQ2UPK_Q2U_Handheld_Dynamic_Microphone.html)

### Why it works

- It sounds good
- It rejects background sounds really well
- It inludes all the accessories you need to start
- It supports USB so you don't need additional hardware
- It supports XLR so you can upgrade it with a better interface

### Meh

- It's not a great looking mic
- You'll outgrow the included accessories pretty quickly

### Suitable and similar alternatives

- [Audio-Technica AT2005USB](https://amzn.to/3rkbvJ1)
- [Audio-Technica AT2100x-USB](https://amzn.to/3dsCcz0)

I used the AT2100USB to record the 2016-2018 episodes of [Bird Call Review](http://birdcallreview.com).
The two mics above are newer versions of that mic.

These are very similar to the Samson Q2u but don't include the same useful accessories.
They also sound "thinner" to my ears and they have a blinding, blue "on" LED.

But, pretty close if you can't find stock of the Samson Q2u.

### Why this works

- USB plug-n-play but "upgradeable" to
- Beginner accessories included
- Better isolation from background sounds that popular USB mics (Blue Yeti, et al.)

### Why you might need to upgrade

- Multi-personal, local recording
- Need better source files (24-bit vs 16-bit)
- Electro-magnetic interferance from nearby monitor

## For \$200: Beringer XM8500 mic + Elgato Wave XLR

I know $60 to $200 is a big jump.
If you can't spend at least $200, you're going to be best served by my $60 recommendation.

Buy the mic: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2YOFSqK), [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/215145-REG/Behringer_XM8500_XM8500_Dynamic_ULTRAVOICE.html)
Buy the interface: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3uxAo3D)

### What you get for the extra money

- Better audio
  - 24-bit files are far more editable than 16-bit

- Helpful software
  - Wave Link is audio mixing software that's _only_ available for Elgato Wave mics. It makes mixing audio sources a breeze
- Freedom to explore better (pro) mics

### Why this works

- The Elgato Wave XLR is cheap, sound good, and has decent output gain
- Elgato Wave link makes mixing audio SUPER easy. This is notoriously difficult on a Mac

### Why you might need to upgrade

No.
Those are for interfaces with worse preamps.

This doc is a work in progress.
The recommendations aren't likely to change any time soon.
But I'll flesh out the decision-making nuances a bit.
