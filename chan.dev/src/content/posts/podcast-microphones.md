## Mics to add (in order of purhase)

- Studio Projects C1
- [SM57](https://www.shure.com/en-EU/products/microphones/sm57?variant=SM57-LCE)
  - Didn't have a good enough preamp/interface to drive it
- [Shure PG42-USB](https://www.shure.com/en-EU/products/microphones/pg42usb?variant=PG42-USB)
  - Underestimated how much room noise would be captured by this mic and how much I'd need a pop filter
- Samson Q2U
- [Heil PR 40](https://heilsound.com/product/pr-40/)
  - Was really into a processed radio sound at the time. But the mic just always sounded like too much
- Unsure the order
  - Pyle Handheld Dynamic
  - Rode M2
  - Sennheiser 416
    - This was a $1000 lesson in [comb filtering](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/what-is-it-comb-filtering/) in a mono recording source.
  - ## Audio-Technica AT875R
  - Shure SM7B
  - Ultravoice MX8500
  - CAD Equitex E100S
  - CAD Equitex E100X
  - Shure MV88
  - Rode
  - Elgato Wave 3
  - VideoMic NTG
    - Returned pretty quickly. Clear it wasn't going to work as a distance off-camera mic in my room.
- Shure MV7
- Earthworks Ethos
- MOVO VXR10 PRO
- MKH 50
- Rode Wireless Pro
  - As I think thru what content looks like for me in the near future, I'm thinking about video interviews. This setup is super versital.
