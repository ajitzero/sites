I hate what we've done with the word "sin".

It means "miss".

"Live! And don't miss"

The woman at the well is a story that resonates with me.
Not because I've had 5 husbands and a lover.
But because I've had a bunch of jobs that I hate.

I accepted less than I was worth.

All of Jesus encounters with individuals are about a transformation from shame to â€¦
This one is no different.

Jesus says "live. and don't miss"

I love that.
