title: Become who you are

The day after Rock was born, Nellie and I went to a friends graduation party (without Rock).

The first of our friends to get married and have kids, we wanted to prove that we didn't have to change.

Thet belief has palgued every seasonof my life since. I've believed that I could acrete life's experiences without changing.

When Ruby was diagnosed with cancer, I didn't change.
When my dad died, I didn't change.
(planning center, podcast, etc.)

I've always wanted to be "the same guy."

But I'm not. I'm new every day.
