## Your keyboard is under-utilized

## Modding philosophy

My rules for remapping.

1. **Never break rollover.** Only create layers from keys typically followed by a space. e.g., <kbd>.</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd>, <kbd>'</kbd>, <kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>;</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>.
2. Prize symmetry.

## Why software-level mapping?

## Embrace clojurescript

## Ideas

- double-tapping a modifier locks it (cmd, shift, ctrl, option (meh?))
- hitting both right and left version of key perform some type of common action

## Unstructured notes

- for modifier keys: remap keys, not positions (this is important for being able to maintain availability to hardware opinions
- for home cluster keys: map positions, not characters. makes it easier to change layouts and optimizes for hand position
- two finger commands should always be done with two hands or with one hand, never leaving a neutral position
- daily commands with more than two keys get mapped to homerow
- commands that remove either hand from home row get mapped
- one directional cluster for each hand

home cluster vs home row

- capture
- display
- window
- file
- open
- location (2:2426, 3:3000, 4:4321, 6:6006, 7:7689)
- character (no character layer. thatâ€™s what a keyboard is for)
- direction (left mod, right action)
- move (left mod,
- select (left mod,
- one control on each side
- god mode (switch profile?) qwerty left hand no command (<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> mode?)
  - select all
  - save
  - cut, copy, paste
  - undo / redo (shift)
  - move forward/back
  - move to front/back
- mapping for davinci, to whatever is default
