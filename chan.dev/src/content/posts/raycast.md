**I'd like this to be a guide**

## Commands

<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> - List options for command

### Basics

1. <kbd>ESC</kbd> navigate back one page
1. <kbd>⌘ ESC</kbd> navigate back to main page

## Tip: alias

Typing the alias, followed by a space, directly opens a Command, saving you an extra step

## Workflows to demo in "what's in my Raycast"

Theme: reducing friction for every day things. #lube

- Calendar
- Quick link for most opened VS Code projects
  - Create
  - Duplicate
- Using quick links in tandem with Arc Flight Control to launch in-browser apps (in different profiles even)
- Ergonomic emoji selection (`tab`)
  - Replace default keyboard shortcut
  - [Unregistering the emoji keyboard on mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/15j3pza/comment/juxx8ib/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
- Expense formatting with snippets
- multi-clipboard history

- Create a new extension for getting a VS Code url for a file path. Can this be a service? That would be dope. Maybe it's a Shortcut or script.

- [Create Quick Event](https://www.raycast.com/mblode/quick-event/commands). I Really like the native Quick Event environment. This simply brings it into Raycast
- [Navigator/Menu Item Search](https://www.raycast.com/changelog/1-20-0). I use help search all of the time. This makes it one less thing I need a mouse for.

Unregister these commands to utilize <kbd>hyper + c</kbd>
