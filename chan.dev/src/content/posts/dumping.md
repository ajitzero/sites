As a friend, I'm a _fecal diagnostician_.

I like to get into it.
Lay it all out.
Sift thru it and find the problem.

My enthusiasm gives folk the idea that I "just like shit."

**I don't.**

So when _diagnosing_ turns to _dumping_, I'm out.  
And I've left a lot of folks dumbfounded as to why.

I think we all have extremely nuanced boundaries around our identities.
Inside our boundary is pure delight.
And just outside of it is utter disdain.

But I'm getting better at saying:
"Don't dump here. Diagnostic deposits only, dude."
