## First Comparison

This test was run to compare the natural sound of the [Shure MV7][mv7] compared to the [Shure SM7B][sm7b].

Every mic has a different sweet spot.  
But as a first step, I set this mic up in the same position I set my [SM7B][] in — pointed at the corner of my mouth, at a 45 degree angle, with the capsule about 4-5" away.

Here are the results:

### Takeaway

To my ear (using [ATH-M40x headphones][m40x]) the MV7 is noisier than the [SM7B][sm7b].  
I'm using the same preamp for both.  
So I suspect this is electromagnetic interference noise.  
The [SM7B][sm7b] is exceptionally.  
The MV7 doesn't seem to be.

The [Mv7][mv7] sounds very "metallic" to me.  
There are a few words where you can hear a resonant, metallic, ringing — which is my least favorite sound in a mic.

It's not nearly as warm as the [SM7B][sm7b] — one of the most desirable characteristics of that mic.  
This is understandable, given the smaller capsule.  
But either way, you're not getting that classic low response.

## Compared to the best sounding USB mic I've found

Last year I one a one page resource of my favorite hybrid (USB/XLR) Mic, the [Samson Q2U][q2u]:

http://shutupandstarttalking.com

I take the [Q2U][q2u] with me every time I'm away from my home studio and might need to record.  
It's sounds way better than it should for a pre-COVID price of \$60.

Attached are samples of it compared to

#### Shure MV7

### Takeaway

The [Q2U][q2u] makes the [MV7][mv7] sounds thin and metallic — to my ears (using [ATH-M40x headphones][m40x]).  
So metallic, I could taste it under my tongue.

The capsule is clearly no Unidyme III variant (SM7B, SM58, SM57) but it doesn't even sound like as balanced as a generic dynamic to me.

This is super disappointing.

Now, for positives, the wind screen deed do better that the [Q2U][q2u]'s included screen.

The [MV7][mv7] is WAY better looking than the [Samson Q2u][q2u].  
And It's getting harder and harder to find this mic for less than $100.  
Add to that an ~~internal shock mount (not great),~~ cool stand adapter and software which seems to eq the sound at capture time, and the new MV7 has a lot of potential for a practical difference of maybe $150.

But, it's sad that a $250 mic from Shure doesn't sound as balanced — out of the box, to my ears, for podcasting — as a $60 mic from a 3rd rate electronics brand.

## MV7 USB vs XLR

The [MV7s][mv7] USB and XLR interfaces sound SHOCKINGLY different on this mic.

Because most of my testing to this point was with the XLR, I was very unimpressed.  
But the USB input is much fuller.  
While I find the low mids to be a little woofy and undefined, I'm sure it could be fixed with a slightly different mic position or an adjustment to the ShurePlus MOTIV companion app.

First checkout the wild difference between the two interfaces on this mic:

### MV7 via USB

No software eq or compression enabled in ShurePlus MOTIV app.

### Takeaway

This really isn't intended as an XLR mic.  
It's a cheap capsule that's been tuned in the in-built interface to sound better than it is.

It's best to think of this as a really nice USB mic, with a chance to explore XLR-based gear in the future.

Unfortunately, it'll be a pretty sharp cliff as you won't be able to easily get back to your familiar tone without diving into eq.

This makes it hard to recommend as a "hybrid".

## Misc

- This mic isn't heavy enough to work with my favorite budget stand for podcasters, the [Podcast Pro by Accu-Lite/O.C. White](https://www.ocwhite.com/product/podcast-pro-microphone-boom/) (\$89).
- The in-built headphone amp is clean but not powerful. I'm at 100% all the time and regularly reaching for more volume.
- The ShurePlus MOTIV app is does a tremendous job of reducing very technical concepts to a few toggles and sliders. This will be huge for folks without A/V backgrounds
