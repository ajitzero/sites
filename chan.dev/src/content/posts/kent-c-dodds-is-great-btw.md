Kent is my real-life Ted Lasso.

Kent believes in me.
And he believes in you.
Never, have I ever, met someone who thinks so positively of everyone.
And with everything on his mind — family, faith, following, etc — it's amazing he makes time to think of others at all.

He's thought of me in ways that are deeply personal, and has made me feel capable in ways I didn't believe.

Kent, you're the best.  
I love you, friend.
