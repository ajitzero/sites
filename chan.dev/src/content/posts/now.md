## Epic React 2

I am developing a new [Epic React][] with friends [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/), [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/), [Taylor Bell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-bell-0644b131), and the [Skill Recordings](https://www.skillrecordings.com/) crew.

[Epic React] is the best way for professional React developers to level up their skills. We're taking it to the next level with TypeScript, a new workshop experience, Next.js + Server Components, and a fresh lineup of expert interviews.

## Learning video production

My current path is video production.

After a few years of [podcasting][react podcast] and microphones, I wanted to learn more about video production.

I'm making videos (when I can) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@chantastic).
