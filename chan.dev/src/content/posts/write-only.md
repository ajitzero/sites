description: Doing "content" wrong. A write-only approach to doing personal work and unshackling from social algorithms.

I think I'm ok with doing "content" wrong.

When I took a job in developer experience, I felt responsible for understanding social algorithms.

And it made me not want to post.

- Capitalize on trends
- Shitpost
- "Niche down to blown up"
- "be wrong on the internet"

And tuning into it has made my feed… insufferable.

It all just keeps me in loop, on edge, under pressure, missing out…  
And I'm looking for less of :gesticulates-wildly: _all that_.

I'm switching to _write-only_ sharing for the next few months.  
I'll share what I make, make what I want, and fuck-all with the rest.
