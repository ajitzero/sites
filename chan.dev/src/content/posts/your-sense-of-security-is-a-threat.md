All of our fighting is over a sense of security.

When I fight with Nellie about money,

It’s a fight over security.

I want the security of having money.

She wants the security having experiences.

When I fight with my team over a design,

We’re fighting over security.

I want the security of having stability.

They want the security of having the freedom of expression.

Neither side is right.

Neither side is wrong.

We’re fighting for our own security — at the expense of others.

But if we can identify that familiar motivation in others,

Their position doesn’t feel as far away.

We can empathize because we want the same thing.

So be mindful.

Security is threatening.

Consider how yours threatens those you fight with.

Your friend,
