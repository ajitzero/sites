There's an episode of Ted Lasso where Roy Kent gives a monologue about what it felt like to be back at Manchester United (?). He ends with some line like "i wonder what it might have been like if I stayed and just enjoyed it."

I can't find it anywhere because it doesn't stand out on the internet amongst all of his more salty quotes. But it hit me harder than any scene in the movie. That he wonders what it might have been like but it never would have happened.
