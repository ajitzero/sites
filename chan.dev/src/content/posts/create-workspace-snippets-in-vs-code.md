## Surround in snippet

VS Code provides variables for snippets.
`TM_SELECTED_TEXT` places your selected text in the snippet.

To utilize this variable, you can't rely on autocomplete (because typing would delete your selection).

Open the [Command Palette][https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette].
Select `Snippets: Surround with Snippetâ€¦`. And select the snippet you'd like to use.

Alternatively, establish a keyboard shortcut for `editor.action.showSnippets` _when_ `editorTextFocus`.

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+s",
  "command": "editor.action.showSnippets",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

## Other notes

- I think that if you want to have language specific project files, you have to build them up as extensions.
