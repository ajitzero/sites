I've never felt that sense of social elation that folks feel their "(FO)Missing Out" on.

At any event there are makers and takers.
We makers don't get the experience of FOMO.
We just get FOM. The fear of Missing.
Missing an expectation. Missing a deadline. Missing a goal.
Missing a chance to have done ore best and shown up completely.
