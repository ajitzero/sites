### Use tailwindcss's `resolveConfig` function to access full config in JS

[My response to an issue in Storybook.](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/25483#discussioncomment-8027117)

Doc for `Referencing in JavaScript`.

Snippet:
```js
import resolveConfig from 'tailwindcss/resolveConfig'
import tailwindConfig from './tailwind.config.js'

const fullConfig = resolveConfig(tailwindConfig)

fullConfig.theme.width[4]
// => '1rem'

fullConfig.theme.screens.md
// => '768px'

fullConfig.theme.boxShadow['2xl']
// => '0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)'
```

## Install storybook from branch

This is useful when you need to build `sandbox` from the latest no-alpha. At least until the `sandbox` command can be version scoped.

```bash
npx storybook@latest sandbox --branch=main
