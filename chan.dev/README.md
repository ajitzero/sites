Hi ðŸ‘‹

Any help you'd like to provide is appreciated.
As a personal site, I assume that will be mostly in the way of typo fixes and such.

## Setup

- clone and cd into project directory
- `pnpm i`
  - should all work with `npm` and `bun`. i'm just using `pnpm` rn
- `pnpm dev`

## What you can learn

This is a pretty great example of using Astro for robust personal sites.  
Dig aronud find stuff you like. Let me know how it works for you.
