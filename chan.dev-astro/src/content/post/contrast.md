I’m always on the hunt for contrast.
It’s why I like comedy-horror so much.
The juxtaposition of a hero spitting jocose one-liners, while being dismembered… it just hits.

Our curse is that _every thing_ becomes _every day_.

Climbing Mt. Everest is a lifetime goal for many. But for a sherpa, it’s a day job. By contrast, a sherpa’s lifetime goal may seem comparatively banal to us.

So, contrast is the antidote… right?

If so, how do we keep contrast?
How do we assemble adversity?
Do we chase chaos — churning the waters by constantly changing course.
Do we dive into depravation — duping our brains into delight by self-denial?
Or do we follow fundamentalists — foraging for fixation by going farther and finding fresh insights?

None.
We embrace complexity.

We’re capable of struggling on one axis of life and thriving on another.

And while I pine for a sugary, static, undisrupted life… its complexity that keeps contrast high — across experiences.

Framed as a comedy-horror:
I may have lost a hand to an army evil dead,
But I’ve still got a biting whit.
