title: My Career Changed on a Water Slide

There's a water slide at a local resort where my career changed.

At the end of 2013, I wrote my first React component.
It got 86'd in code review but it was clear that React was the future I wanted.

So, that spring â€” on a weekend vacation â€” I read the React docs on my phone while Rock went up and down a children's water slide a hundred times.

He didn't mind me ignoring him and I didn't mind him splashing my every 45 seconds.

I had no idea how that hour would direct my next five years.

The company I work for ended up writing a React app.
The lessons I learned turned into a [bunch](https://learnreact.com) [of](https://reactcheatsheet.com) [resources](https://reactpatterns.com), [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERB1TJBn32c&t=4s) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZg8wg39QQ) [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9-Mb_axNgA) [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NP_upexPFg), and then React Podcast.

5 1/2 years later, I'm at JSConf US watching Ruby go down the same slide a hundred times.
This time I'm actually watching â€” grateful and nostalgic for all the people I've met and moments we've shared.
