title: Stop Failing Yourself
description: "Perfectionism holds you back from sharing your work. Don't let fear of criticism stop you from growing. Embrace imperfection, share your creations, and watch your life improve. Are you hiding from your potential?"

If you want your life to be worse,  
Don't share your work.

In school, I wouldn't turn in a paper if I didn't _feel_ like it was "good work."  
Of course the whole point of school is show bad work.

I protected myself with the "perfectionist" narrative.  
It's an easy lie to believe when you're afraid of criticism.  
It allowed me to interpret my failing grades as a virtue.

Perfectionism is the horsiest of horse shits.  
You're an adult.  
You can handle a little rejection.

If you don't share your work, you're not a perfectionist â€”  
You're just scared.

Stop hiding your work because you're scared.
