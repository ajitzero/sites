On unemployment, you get a paper check.
Attached is a form you send back for your next check. Miss the return window and there's no next check.

I missed one and felt properly fucked.

You can't call unemployment in the middle of a recession.
I'd try, when the office opened, and I'd sit on hold until they dropped the line.

I gave up.

I've never felt shame like being on unemployment. Every day my heart broke as employment applications went unanswered and open positions closed.

That panic is with me, still.
I was born from it.
All my decisions have roots in it.
So, my heart breaks to see people in it now.

I'm not gonna be a dick and enumerate the ways it was good for me. That isn't helpful.
I will say how grateful I am for people like [Jeffery Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way), [Geoffrey Grosenbach](https://twitter.com/topfunky), and [Dan Benjamin](https://twitter.com/danbenjamin) who showed me a new path by sharing what they knew.
They didn't know me but their sharing gave me direction.

I couldn't have made it thru without them and I feel a huge responsibility to share what I know in response.

I hope you will too, creators.
People need you right now.
