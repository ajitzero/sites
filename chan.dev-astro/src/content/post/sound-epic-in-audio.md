Audio is becoming more important for communication.

Starting a podcast?  
Recording videos for YouTube?  
Taking your first remote job?

Presenting yourself well with audio is critical.

I host a podcast.

I spent \$5000 the past couple years trying to figure it out.  
And here's my answer:

You can get 80% epic for 60 bucks.  
Spend the right \$60 and the mic will grow with you â€” getting you closer to to 90% epic.

I made a little microsite to with my recommendation,
Complete with samples.
