If you want to protect your work,
You need to do three things.

Disclaimer:
I'm not a lawyer.
This isn't legal advice.
This is just what I remember paying a lawyer \$500 to tell me.
Ask a lawyer for the full scoop.

Good?
Let's continue

**Register your work.**
Registered work is easier to protect.
Copyright.gov has a page for registering your work.
https://www.copyright.gov/registration/

**Protect your work.**
Take down work that violates your copyright.
Enforce attribution for licensed work.
Put it in writing.
Your diligence builds a strong case that you value your work.

**Get paid for your work.**
Intend to collect damages?
You must prove lost earnings.
Get your analytics in place.
Know what each infringement costs you in dollars.
Lost twitter followers are worthless.

That's what I got.
Do you have lessons that cost you a lot of money to learn?
