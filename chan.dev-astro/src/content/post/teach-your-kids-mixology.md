I taught my kids to make mixed drinks for Mother's Day
If you have kids and want the same, here's what I did:

## Start a citrus tradition

Make orange juice a Sunday morning todo
Fresh squeeze it. Store buy it. It doesn't matter
Just have it

## Add bubbly on special occasions

For birthdays and milestone events, add bubbly to this Sunday citrus tradition

Use proper glassware

Kids get sweet bubbles
Adults get dry bubbles

## Seed the question for Mother's Day

Hey kids, tomorrow is a special occasion ‚Äî Mother's Day  
What drink can we make to celebrate mom?

You're off to the races now
Citrus and alcohol is the start of every great mixed drink
