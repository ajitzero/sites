title: Stop making dents
description: "Religions remind us of our fleeting existence. Instead of striving to 'make a dent,' embrace peace, learn from the past, and share your knowledge. How can you be generous with today?"

Something most religions agree on is how cosmically unimportant an individual is.

They differ in the specifics but â€” in general â€” most religions tell you to think of yourself and your circumstances less.

Because you are momentary.  
You are the universe before you and the universe after you.

So why be so intent to "make a dent"?

Instead, be at peace â€” receive truth from the past, enrich it with insight from the present, and â€” in doing so â€” prepare it for the future.

Don't withhold anything;  
There's nothing you can keep.  
Be grateful and pass it on.

What can you give away today?
