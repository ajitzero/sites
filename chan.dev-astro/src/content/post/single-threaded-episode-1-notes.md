Today [Jenn Creighton](https://twitter.com/gurlcode/) launched [single-threaded podcast](https://anchor.fm/single-threaded). I'm thrilled ðŸ¥³

Jenn joined me [on React Podcast in November](https://reactpodcast.com/episodes/118) and her episode is fire. Listening to it with the [Discord](https://events.lunch.dev/discord) crew unlocked new ways for us to talk about our feelings and experiences.

So, we're getting the crew together to learn even more from Jenn, with [single-threaded episode parties](https://discord.com/channels/105756917887950848/809132246169944076/811641220613931020), Wednesdays 10am PT.

I'm amazed at how this first episode turned out. Jenn is a natural and [Erin Fox](https://anchor.fm/single-threaded/episodes/Erin-Fox-on-Interviewing-eqg5nn) is an incredible first guest.

Jenn and Erin brought the funny and I LOL'd hard. But they were remarkably candid about their career experiences.

All-in-all a killer first episode.

## Quote and notes

_These are not direct quotes. They are summaries, as I heard them. Listen to the full episode for accurate quotes and requisite context. The provided timestamps should get you close._

> Your first insight into a company's culture is their interview process.
> â€”Â Erin @0:07

> You're testing for the wrong things, if your interview process tests only for high pressure situations.
> â€”Â Jenn @0:08

> A 5 year plan is nonsense. Ask if your [personal] aspirations match what the company is looking for â€”Â and vice-versa?
> â€”Â Jenn @0:12

> Ask for a take-home "exception" for coding challenges. It's almost always on option.
> â€”Â Jenn @0:12

> Take-home challenges usually come with a time limit. Disregard it. They expect you to finish.
> "Yeah. I Spent about 4 hours." In reality it was 12 and I didn't sleep.
> â€”Â Erin @0:17

> Don't interview with your favorite company first. Save them for later in the process to get your interview skill back up.
> Erin @0:19

> Interview on Thursday or Friday. People feel better those days. Everyone is sad on Monday. No Monday interviews.
> Erin @0:20

> Sometimes, when you get rejected it's because the company can't properly support you and someone is looking out for you.
> Jenn @0:24

> The more I interviewed the more I learned to not put all my eggs in one basket. It took awhile, to learn when to finally get excited, but in the end it's worth it to wait.
> Erin in Discord Chat, answering how to not get attached any one position.

> When you're waiting, or handling a rejection, do a thing you're good at. For me, that's be baking.
> Erin @0:28

> publishDate lots of companies
> @0:31

## Follow-up questions

In our post-episode chat, I asked Erin how her experience as a baker has informed her coding career.

_(personal summary, note quote)_

> Recipes are usually paired with a story. Stories are just as important as recipes.
>
> Code stories don't get passed down as much as they should. Solutions and patterns have a history that illustrates their value. It's important to share solutions with the stories that inspired them.
