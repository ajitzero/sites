title: It Takes what it Takes â€”  On Dyslexia

I have dyslexia.

Dyslexia is often represented as letters all jumbled up
But that's not totally accurate.

For me it's the experience of reading something,
Thinking I understand it,
Then realizing I misread key words or negations â€” like "not" on "n't" â€” that change the intent.
Or I transpose "Meeting at 3PM" to "Meeting at 4PM" for no discernible reason.

As a result, it takes me longer to do everything.
I double and triple check my work and â€” despite extra attention â€” I often throw out large swaths of effort done in the wrong direction.

This forced me to learn patience.
It takes what it takes to get a job done.
I can learn to enjoy the entire process
Or do half the work pissed that I'm still doing it.

Be patient with yourself.
You'll get there; enjoy the whole process.
