Thanks for letting me in this year.

When I started writing into the void, I assumed that this would be a fun way to catalogue a few thoughts and memories Iâ€™d never shared  
But you showed up and that changed everything.

My favorite thing about last year was getting to know you,  
Share your journey,  
Feel your struggle,  
And move forward together.

Iâ€™m grateful for you  
And Iâ€™m thrilled to see how weâ€™ll move forward together in this decade.
