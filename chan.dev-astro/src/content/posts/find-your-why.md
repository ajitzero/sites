You need a motive to convict someone of a crime.
Motive is just a crimey word for **why**.

**Why** is philosophy.
When you have **why**,
_Who_,
_What_,
_Where_,
_When_,
And _how_ quickly follow.

If you were on trial for your work,
Could **why** convict you?
Is your work littered with evidence of your **why**?
**Why** not?

Brilliant leaders ask **"why?"**.
Great organizations know **why**.
Admit it...
Just thinking of **why** gets you excited.
**Why** is thrilling.

What are you working on right now?
Is it backed by **why**?
If not,
**Why** not?

Let's find your **why**.
Just hit reply.
