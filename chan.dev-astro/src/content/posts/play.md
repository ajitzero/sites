My theme for 2022 is **play**.

Yes, it's almost February.
I take my time and I'm good with me ðŸ˜Š

I've believed that pressure is what makes me produce work.
That belief is probably from my work-focused immigrant upbringing. Or maybe it's from a pull-quote I read by a productive but unhappy designer. Wherever it came from, it's a belief I'd like to challenge.

I'm inspired by [Derek Sivers, who learned that stress earned him a mere 4% gain in his regular bike rides](https://sive.rs/relax).

I'm inspired by creative engineers [Sara Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/), [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), [Lynn Fisher](https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic), and [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), who make play a fixture of their tech careers.

But I'm inspired most by an article from Jonny Sun:

> Most rocks, I assume, donâ€™t turn into diamonds under extreme pressure. _â€”Â [#17. Rock (ordinary)](https://jonnysun.bulletin.com/17-rock)_

Why am I pushing to be a hard diamond, when I could be a happy rock?

Let's play!
