If you want your life to be worse,  
Don't share your work.

In school, I wouldn't turn in a paper if I didn't _feel_ like it was "good work."  
Of course the whole point of school is show bad work.

I protected myself with the "perfectionist" narrative.  
It's an easy lie to believe when you're afraid of criticism.  
It allowed me to interpret my failing grades as a virtue.

Perfectionism is the horsiest of horse shits.  
You're an adult.  
You can handle a little rejection.

If you don't share your work, you're not a perfectionist â€”  
You're just scared.

Stop hiding your work because you're scared.
