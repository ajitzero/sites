Kevin and Bobby started a new podcast: [Essentially Useless](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYSOVLrjLDr7m5LIJs876mw).

Kevin hit me up for a mic recommendation — budget: $150/person.

## Recommendation

[Elgato Wave:3](https://amzn.to/3qHr3RU)

Bobby is a yeller. Yelling is a nightmare to mix. It's also a big problem for streams — where platform compression can make digital peaks unlistenable.

Elgato Wave has the only reliable (software limiter) I've tested. Limiting is something I've spent hundreds to solve with hardware. At $150, the Elgato Wave is a bargain mic for yellers looking to improve their stream.

## Why it I recommend it

This mic is the pinnacle of USB-mic technology, sporting a classy design, in an affordable package.

### Clipguard

[Elgato Clipguard anti-distortion technology](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044558992-Wave-Link-Clipguard) is the killer feature of Wave. I've never recommended a USB-only mic until the Elgato Wave announcement. That's because USB-mics aren't extensible.

When I started podcasting and streaming, the first first piece of outboard gear I needed was a limiter/compressor. But that's all I've needed.

To keep a strong and peak-free audio signal, I tried the [DBX 286s ($229)](https://amzn.to/3dM0kQH) — which I _do not_ recommend. I eventually landed on the [SoundDevices MixPre-3 ($899)](https://amzn.to/3pEGEQP) — which I love.

But, $229 is the entry point for solving this issue with hardware. And that's outside of the $150 budget.

Elgato to the rescue with the only software-powered clipping solution I've seen that works. I'm not sure how they do it but, in my tests, Clipguard is a reliables limiter. Making it well worth the $150 price-tag.

### Lewitt inside

Wave was designed my Lewitt. If you don't know much about audio, Lewitt makes incredible microphones. As an A/V nerd, this is what captured my attention.

I trust them just as much as industry titans Shure, Rode, and Audio-Technica.

The mic has an incredibly low self-noise, sounds great, and does an admirable job (for a condenser) at rejecting background noise.

### Attractive

This thing looks nice and is small enough to disappear from the frame.

I lke the old [RCA-style](https://www.google.com/search?q=rca+microphone&tbm=isch&chips=q:rca+microphone,g_1:antique:ZzHwV--NZ0g%3D&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjy6_mp7fvuAhUYhp4KHZXAAcIQ4lYoAXoECAEQGw&biw=1386&bih=922) look in a contemporary matte black.

## The competition

There is no competition in this space.

## Should I buy a Wave:1 or Wave:3?

The street price of the [Wave:1](https://amzn.to/3k9DC5Q) is $130. The [Wave:3](https://amzn.to/3qHr3RU) is regularly discounted to $145.

At a $15 difference, absolutely get the Wave:3. But if you can only find the Wave:3 at retail ($159), and that $30 is a deal-breaker, [here's what you need to know](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044720472-Elgato-Wave-1-How-Does-It-Compare-To-Wave-3-).

There are 3 major differences:

- Wave:1 lacks a capacitive mute button
- Wave:1's hardware dial only controls headphone volume (not gain or mic/pc mix)
- Wave:1 has a max sample rate of 48kHz

Other than that, it's the same mic and all features can be controlled via [Elgato WaveLink software](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051604911-Wave-Link-Using-Elgato-Wave-microphone-and-Wave-Link-with-NVIDA-Broadcast).

## Compromises

The compromise with this mic is that build quality.

I think that's a great compromise because folks can't feel your mic thru the stream and you won't be touching it a whole lot.

Compare that to the [Shure MV7](https://chan.dev/notes/shure-mv7/) which retains a high build quality but at the expense of shit sound.

## Accessories

### Elgato Wave Pop Filter

[Elgato Wave Pop Filter ($29)](https://amzn.to/2ZzOYa3) is an attractive design pop filter if you want to get right up on your mic. But I had no trouble with the build-in pop filter — with the mic placed about 6" from my face at a 45 degree angle.

### Elgato Wave Shock Mount

[Elgato Wave Shock Mount ($39)](https://amzn.to/2OYLGuW) is in attractive minimal shock mount. I like it. But the included crap-plastic mount isn't terrible either. Try it without and see how it does for you.

## Bottom Line

[Elgato Wave:3](https://amzn.to/3qHr3RU) is the best microphone for streamers and podcasters on a budget. Clipguard is worth every penny, even if the mic didn't sound great. But it does. At ~$150, it can't be beat.
