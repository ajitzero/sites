Every idea starts as a conflated ball of ideas  
Attached to it are your biases, protective tactics, and fears

Your work — as steward of an idea — is to cut off everything that doesn't belong

But these cuts aren't obvious  
You have to impose a your vision to find the right lines

For example:
Have you seen a wild bonsai tree?  
It's just a shrub

Have you seen a tri-tip steak when it's still a cow's muscle?
You wouldn't be able to find it

The cut lines are set by your vision
You are the one that decides where to cut

Be patient; It takes time
Stay persistent and you'll catch a glimpse of that perfect shape — beyond biases, protective tactics, and fears

When you see it, cut
