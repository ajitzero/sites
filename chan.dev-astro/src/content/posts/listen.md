I started this letter the way I started every letter — with something honest about me

I tried to relate my experience of growing up with an immigrant dad to what's going on today

It was a stupid exercise

I can't understand the depth of Black suffering  
I don't see half-Asians regularly murdered by police  
I don't have to daily overcome centuries of systemic racism

So — this week — my job isn't to be relatable.  
My job is to listen, trust lived experiences, and respond with compassion and partnership

I encourage you to listen to Black voices,
