I'm in bed with the flu.  
I've been here for 6 days.  
For that entire time I've been quarantined to my office â€” keeping the rest of my family from the same fate.

I hear everything happening â€”  
Stories being read,  
Games being played,  
Neighbors visiting â€”  
But I'm not taking part in any of it.

I'm back here doing work, watching seasons of television I've missed, and thinking about death.  
I think about relatives who passed and how â€” toward the end â€” they became mentally or physically detached from their lives.  
And that scare the shit out me.
But it's a great reminder.

Right now I have health and family â€” a once in a lifetime adventure.  
There is always work to done,  
There is always TV to catch up on,  
And there is always death.  
But life is right now.

When I get out of this bed I plan join my family and knock the pants off the remaining weeks of summer.

Care to join me?
