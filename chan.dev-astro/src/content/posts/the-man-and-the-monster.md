We have to achieve what Dr Jekyll couldn't.

In every person lives creator and critic.  
For a lucky few, those are in near balance.  
But for the rest of us, we trend woefully toward one end of the continuum.

Too critical to publish or to creative to progress.

Your work requires that you build a boundary between the man and the monster.  
But how will you succeed where the doctor failed?

You'll be better prepared.

My favorite creatives have fight this battle and shared their tactics:

- [You and You, Inc.](https://stevenpressfield.com/2017/02/you-inc/) — Steven Pressfield
- [Muse and Mule](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_your_elusive_creative_genius) — Elizabeth Gilbert
- [Maker and Manager](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) — Paul Graham

Each of these thoughts guides me thru different struggles.  
**Maker and Manager** is a framework of dividing a day into distinct modes.  
**You and You Inc** is a defense against imposter syndrome.
And **Muse and Mule** is a comfort when luck doesn't show.
